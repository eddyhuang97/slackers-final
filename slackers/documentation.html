Dataset:

</h1>


<p>
The dataset was found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd"> here. </a>
</p>

<p>
It is titled <i> “Global Terrorism Database,” </i> containing information of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970-2017. However, we simplified this data to include attacks only found within the United States in the same time frame.

<p>
Purpose:
</p>
</h1>
<p>
The purpose of our application is to interact with a dataset on terrorism. Pertinent information include where these attacks have happened, when they happened between 1970-2017, what type of attack and who the attackers/target were. 
</p>
<p>
A user has the choice to interact with different options of types of attack/target/attacker to see relevant information on charts or maps and draw analyses.
