<bold> Dataset: </bold>
</p>

<p>
The dataset was found here: https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd
It is titled “Global Terrorism Database,” containing information of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970-2017. However, we simplified this data to include attacks only found within the United States in the same time frame.

<p>
<bold> Purpose: </bold>
</p>
<p>
The purpose of our application is to interact with a dataset on terrorism. Pertinent information include where these attacks have happened, when they happened between 1970-2017, what type of attack and who the attackers/target were. 
</p>
<p>
A user has the choice to interact with different options of types of attack/target/attacker to see relevant information on charts or maps and draw analyses.

<bold> Who Are We? </bold>
</p>
<p>
We are INFO 201 BE students who are using technology and programming languages to analyze data and create data visualizations to better understand datasets. Using R, we are able to filter through data and understand what it all means by displaying it into different graphs and maps.
