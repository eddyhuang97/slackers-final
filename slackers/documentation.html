Who Are We?
</p>
</h1>

<p>
We are <b>INFO 201 BE</b> students who use technology and programming languages to analyze data. We use our skills in these areas to create interactive data visualizations that help people better understand information. By wrangling data in R, we're able to design a better means of communicating information using such things as graphs and maps.
</p>

<p>
Our team consists of Eddy Huang, Jaylen Willingham, Shakeel Khan, and Ansul Sinha.   
</p>

<h1>
<p>
Purpose:
</p>
</h1>
<p>
Our application builds an experience between viewers and the visualizations on terrorism in the United States. Pertinent information includes where attacks have happened, when they happened between the years 1970 to 2017, what type of attacks were made, and number of attacks in the U.S. by nationality of attackers. 
</p>
<p>
A user has the choice to choose different options that then reflect within the visualizations in order for them to draw their own conclusions.

Dataset:
</p>
</h1>
<p>
The raw dataset can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd"> here. </a>
</p>

<p>
It is titled <i> “Global Terrorism Database,” </i> containing information of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970-2017. However, we simplified this data to include attacks only found within the United States in the same time frame.
